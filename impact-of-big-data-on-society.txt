Impact of Big Data on Society
==================================================

"The only questions left will be answered by computers because only computers
will know what to ask"
  -- James Cameron, 1969 (a journalist, shockingly not a quote from Terminator)

  - Flightcaster, Woke, startups
  - Google guy

How dependent will we get on data?
--------------------------------------------------

Very dependent.  Saves time, enables things you wouldn't be able to do.


Challenge is figuring out what to ignore. Better filtering.

Will we stop asking questions and wait for computers to just tell us what to
do? Will we just "taste the data".
--------------------------------------------------

- People that use twitter too much would have been stupid anyway.
- A large portion of the population will just consume "data channels"
- We'll build new systems. Now we only have search.  Over time we'll have more
  other systems that do other things for us.  We're in the "search phase of the web".
- What people say about them selves is less useful than what they do.  Better
  for analytics and prediction

Privacy - What about assumption of guilt since everyone will expected to track
everything (like location)? Won't turning off your phone make you look guilty?
--------------------------------------------------
- We're data nerds, so we don't really care about this.

What about your search history?  How can people "own" that valuable
behaviorable data?
--------------------------------------------------
- People are never more honest than with the seach bar.
- Google guy gets really nervous and awkward.

What are you most worried about?
--------------------------------------------------
- Expectation to record everything.
- @caseorganic: Most organizations use data to detect trends, not to track
  individuals.  Don't worry about it.  It's really useful data.
- Data can be misleading when naively tied to an individual (person who
  searches for medical aliments, for their sick family members.)

What is the next big thing?
--------------------------------------------------
- Location Data - "Remote control for reality" - Tells you where you're going
  instead of where you are.
- Internet connected to mobile
  - You could have a "personal learner" on the server some where, that just
    figures shit out for you.
  - Google guy mashes up contact history with social network.  "I can see I
    haven't contacted this whole social group for a while."
