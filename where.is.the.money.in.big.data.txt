    - are not in storage in compute

  - Next generation of algorithmic search coming afterwards, seeded by the
    curated datasets
  - People are trying to out-google google, with better search algorithms, but
    that's dumb

  - Zingged yahoo for unloading delicious since that's curation which is the
    next big thing. Idiots!
  - Curation can "seed" future search.
  - The runway needs to be really long if you're selling to enterprises.  You
    need a big patient sales force.

Hottest shit on your list that you want right now?

Paul
  - Pendulum between algorithmic swinging to curation, seeding new algorithms
